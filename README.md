Have you ever used an app like Facebook or Instagram and see a modal that slides up from the bottom of the screen? These bottom-sheet modals are a great way to provide users with additional information or functionality without taking up too much screen space. As a beginner web developer, you might wonder how to create one of these modals yourself.

This modal allows the user to view its contents, drag it up or down, and close it similarly to Facebook. It is responsive and also works on touch-enabled devices like phones.
